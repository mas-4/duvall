# Optional Saturday 9-hole (Drunken) Scramble

All players are encouraged to sign up for the optional 9-hole (drunken) scramble
which takes place Saturday afternoon at 5pm. The scramble is managed by Mark
Thomas and Mark Bodine.

See them at the auction on Friday and let them know your interest in playing so
they can set up the teams. They will also be running a daily SKINS games for
those interested. Again, sign up Friday at the first auction.

For the scramble, each player will pay their cart fee direct to the proshop
prior to teeing off. We have a cheap rate set up for DuVall. Each player will
pay the "prize fee" (usually $20 to $40) to the captain of your foursome (best
handicap) and those proceeds will be used for the payout at the end. Number of
places paid is determined by the number of teams that play in the event.

We encourage everyone to play. It's a great fun way to loosen up after the
Saturday Morning Grind and to meet other guys in the event. The teams are set up
similar to the Sunday scramble so each team has a similar handicap with an A, B,
C & D player.

The cart girls will be stocked and ride the 9-holes with the group meeting their
hydration needs. You're encouraged to buy from them and tip them well as they
are out there JUST FOR US. Only SOLO cups are allowed on the course if you have
your own WATER to take to the first hole.
