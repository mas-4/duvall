# Sunday Scramble Rules

## Florida Scramble

### AKA Step Aside Scramble

Sunday's format is a modified scramble called the Florida Scramble. It's the
same as a typical scramble with one twist. Only three players hit shots after
the tee shot. How it works:

- Players A, B, C, & D hit their tee shots. Just like a typical scramble, the
  team decides which drive to use. In this example they decide player A.
- On the 2nd shot, player A sits out. Only players B, C, & D hit the second
  shot. The team then selects player C's shot.
- On the third shot, player C sits out and player A is back in. Only players A,
  B, & D hit the third shot.
- This process continues until the ball is holed. No gimmies.
- On the next tee box, the process starts all over again and all 4 players hit
  their tee shots.

**TEE SHOT MODIFICATION** — Each Team must use 3 drives from each player. The
drives can be selected after everyone hits, but the team must use 3 drives from
EACH player during the round. A dot should be placed on the scorecard at the
hole under the persons name in which the drive was used.

**SCORING** — As you would expect, there is only one score for the team. You
will put it on the card the same way as previous days, but only on one line
under the A Player (Team Captain). You will record the score and the DuVall
Points as before. At the end of the round, the team will have one score and the
corresponding DuVall points listed.

**Absent Player Rule** — If your team is missing a player (3-man team), you will
change to a standard scramble format where nobody sits out on any shot. You will
play it as a 3-person scramble now. NO SHOTS WILL BE HIT FOR THE MISSING PLAYER.
However, the tee shot modification remains in effect but with the following
change: each person takes an extra drive for a total of 4. Par 3's still DO NOT
count toward the drive count.

We will also make a handicap adjustment for the team as follows:

- Missing A Player = Original handicap + 25% (round UP)
- Missing B Player = Original handicap
- Missing C Player = Original handicap
- Missing D Player = Original handicap - 25% (round DOWN)

Examples:

- If the A player is missing, his handicap will be multiplied by 1.25. So, if
  the A player was a 7 handicap, his absent spot will be 7 &times; 1.25 = 8.75,
  rounded up to 9.
- If the missing player is B or C, their handicaps will be unchanged.
- If the D player is missing, his handicap will be multiplied by 0.75. So, if
  the D player was a 30 handicap, his absent spot will be 30 &times; 0.75 =
  22.5, rounded down to 22.
