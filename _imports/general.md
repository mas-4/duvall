- Return properly marked — totalled scorecards to auction room
  **IMMEDIATELY** following play. Whether you played well or not, be courteous
  to the other golfers by turning in your card as no prize awards can be made
  until **ALL** cards are accounted for.
- Scoring Results and Buyout Information is available at
  [duvallinvitational.com](https://duvallinvitational.com) and is
  updated regularly.
- Be courteous to the other golfers by seeking them out and promptly paying for
  your ½ of the auction buy out. Doing this before the auction is over is best.
  Please don't make the buyer hunt you down. If you can't connect prior to tee
  time, let Greg, Donnie or Myself know of your intent to buy half yourself. It
  MUST be prior to play.
- As in the past, Handicaps are what they are and are set by the computer.  The
  handicap committee only reviews handicaps for those the computer recommends a
  bump of more than 2 points in any year and for newcomers without a history.
  The committee reserves the right to adjust handicaps for any round for any
  newcomer.
- General Rules (see printed rules for details) – Lift, Clean & Place in Fairway Only.  Local Rules for OB or Lost Ball is two strokes and ball placed just in fairway on side of OB or lost ball, but no closer to pin from OB entrance or Lost Ball spot.  Putt Everything Out.  Local Rule for Ground Under Repair on Green or Fairway is condition based.  If condition is not typical for green or fairway, and others in your group agree, then closest point of relief no closer to hole is allowed without changing residing spot (on green must stay on green, fairway must stay in fairway).
- Alt Shot Rules (see printed rules for details) – One player tees off on all even holes and the other on all odd.  No player hits twice in a row.  Who putts last has no bearing on next tee shot.  When selecting original ball vs provisional, the person who hits next is NOT the same one who hit the ball being selected.
